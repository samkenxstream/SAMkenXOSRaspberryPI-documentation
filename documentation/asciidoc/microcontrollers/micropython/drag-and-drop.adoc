== Drag-and-Drop MicroPython

You can program your Pico by connecting it to a computer via USB, then dragging and dropping a file onto it so weâ€™ve put together a downloadable UF2 file to let you install MicroPython more easily.

Download the correct MicroPython UF2 file for your board:

* https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/rp2-pico-latest.uf2[Raspberry Pi Pico] 

* https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/rp2-pico-w-latest.uf2[Raspberry Pi Pico W] (with https://makeblock-micropython-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_library/Third-party-libraries/urequests.html[urequests] and https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/packages.html[upip] preinstalled)

Then go ahead and:

. Push and hold the BOOTSEL button and plug your Pico into the USB port of your Raspberry Pi or other computer. Release the BOOTSEL button after your Pico is connected.

. It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called RPI-RP2.

. Drag and drop the MicroPython UF2 file onto the RPI-RP2 volume. Your Pico will reboot. You are now running MicroPython.

. You can access the REPL via USB Serial. 

The https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf[Raspberry Pi Pico Python SDK] book contains step-by-step instructions for connecting to your Pico and programming it in MicroPython using both the command line and the https://thonny.org/[Thonny] IDE.

WARNING: If you are using an Apple Mac and running macOS Ventura there has been a change in how the Finder works which causes drag-and-drop to fail. This https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/issues/1081[issue] was fixed as of macOS Ventura version 13.1. Please see our https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/the-ventura-problem/[blog post] for a full explanation along with workarounds if you are unable to upgrade to the latest version of Ventura.
